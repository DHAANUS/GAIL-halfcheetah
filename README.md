# Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) â€” PyTorch from Scratch

This repository contains a **from-scratch implementation of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)** in PyTorch.  
GAIL extends the concept of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to imitate expert behavior without explicit access to the reward function.

It has been trained and tested on **MuJoCo control environments** using expert demonstrations, achieving stable policy imitation through adversarial training between a generator (policy) and discriminator.
